# Habit Tracker

A simple Habit Tracker web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**.  
It allows users to add habits, track daily progress for the last seven days, and view their streaks.  
All data is stored locally in the browser with no server required.

## Features

- Add and delete habits instantly  
- Tick daily progress for the past seven days  
- Automatic streak counter showing consecutive days completed  
- Data saved automatically using `localStorage`  
- Export and import data via JSON file for backup  
- Accessible and keyboard-friendly (Tab, Space, and Enter support)  
- Runs directly in the browser with no installation needed

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – logic, DOM manipulation, and localStorage  
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting and deployment

## Reflection

During this project, I learned how to create a complete front-end application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on frameworks.  
The key challenge was learning to dynamically manipulate the DOM and store user data persistently with localStorage.  
I also learned how to structure a clean interface and make the app accessible using ARIA labels and keyboard controls.

Another important learning outcome was understanding how to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages.  
This helped me see how a project can go live without the need for a server or database.

If I were to improve this project, I would add features such as custom date ranges, editable habits, or a progress chart for better visualization.  
Overall, this project strengthened my skills in JavaScript logic, event handling, and building interactive web applications.

## DevOps Learning (Optional)

This project includes a basic CI workflow using **GitHub Actions**.  
It runs **ESLint** automatically on every push to check for JavaScript syntax issues.  
This introduced me to Continuous Integration (CI), where code is verified automatically before deployment.
